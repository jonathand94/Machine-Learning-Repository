# Machine-Learning-Repository
 Project that contains all lecture notes, slides and most code implementations of a full-semester graduate level course of Machine Learning at University Anáhuac Querétaro. 
 
 The course is mainly based on the CS229 graduate level course offered at Stanford and the video lectures publicly published in YouTube taught by Professor Andrew Ng (check http://cs229.stanford.edu/ for details).
