# Machine-Learning-Repository
 Project that contains all lecture notes, slides and most code implementations of a full-semester graduate level course of Machine Learning at University Anáhuac Querétaro. 
 
 The course is mainly based on the CS229 graduate level course offered at Stanford and the video lectures publicly published in YouTube, which are taught by Professor Andrew Ng (check http://cs229.stanford.edu/ for details).

The are stil major updates to make including a full translation of the course from Spanish to English, code updates and Reinforcement Learning lectures.
